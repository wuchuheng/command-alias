# Product Context

_Why this project exists and how it should work_

## Why This Project Exists

**Command Alias** is a cross-platform keyboard shortcut launcher designed to provide macOS CommandAlias-like functionality on Windows and Linux. It solves the productivity gap for users switching from macOS who miss the seamless application launching experience.

## Problems Solved

### Primary Pain Points

- **Slow Application Access**: Traditional Start Menu/Dock navigation is time-consuming
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Alt+Tab doesn't efficiently manage large application sets
- **Process Management Confusion**: Users launch multiple instances instead of focusing existing windows
- **Workflow Interruption**: Breaking concentration to navigate to applications

### Technical Challenges Addressed

- **Cross-Platform Hotkey Registration**: Reliable global shortcuts across operating systems
- **Process Detection**: Smart identification of running applications on Windows
- **Window Management**: Bringing applications to foreground with proper focus handling
- **Data Persistence**: Reliable storage of user customizations and key bindings

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Interactions

1. **Instant Access**: Ctrl+Space â†’ Command Palette appears immediately
2. **Intuitive Input**: Space-separated key sequences (e.g., "c o d e" for VS Code)
3. **Smart Behavior**: Launch new applications or focus existing windows automatically
4. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time filtering and key visualization in command palette

### Secondary Workflows

- **Configuration Management**: Dashboard UI for binding management
- **System Integration**: Tray icon, auto-launch, system startup integration
- **Application Discovery**: Browse and select from installed applications

## Target Users

- **Developers**: Need rapid access to IDEs, terminals, and development tools
- **Power Users**: Manage many applications simultaneously
- **macOS Migrants**: Users transitioning from macOS seeking familiar workflows
- **Productivity Enthusiasts**: Anyone wanting faster application switching

## Success Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 200ms from Ctrl+Space to Command Palette display
- **Accuracy**: 99%+ correct application launching/focusing
- **User Adoption**: Seamless transition from traditional launchers
- **System Performance**: Minimal resource footprint when idle
